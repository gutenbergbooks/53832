Entertainments</i></div>


<p>Teachers are discovering that no matter how
much novelty there is in their entertainment,
how well it is arranged, how thoroughly
drilled, if they want to hold the active interest
of the audience they must use the best of songs.
The songs must be real novelties. The words
must be interesting as well as decidedly clever.
The music must be catchy and abounding in rich
melody. With these things in mind we have
prepared this list of superior song novelties for
our patrons. All are in regular sheet music form.</p>

<h2><a name="A_Strike_in_Santa_Land" id="A_Strike_in_Santa_Land">A Strike in Santa Land</a></h2>


<div class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Stage</span> represents a room in <span class="smcap">Santa’s</span> house. Packages well tied
up are piled in the back of the stage. <span class="smcap">Santa</span> appears ready to
start on his annual journey.</div>
<div class="hangsection">
<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: My, I’m tired. I’m glad Christmas comes but
once a year or I never could stand the excitement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span> [<i>entering</i>]: <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, it’s almost time to start.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Are the reindeer ready and is everything packed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: Yes, I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: I’ve tried trains and autos and airships but none
of them suit me like my faithful old reindeer. I don’t
have to steer them up the chimneys. They know just
where to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>entering</i>]: Well, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, everything is ready
for your trip but I have some unpleasant news for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Unpleasant news—that’s strange. Here in Santa-land
we never hear unpleasant things for they never
happen. What is it <span class="smcap">Jack-of All-Trades</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: Some of the very nicest toys we have made
this whole year refuse to be packed. They say they will
not leave Santa-land and go to earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Well! Well! Well! What do you think of that,
Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, be firm. You’re entirely too easy
with them. They’ll all be wanting to stay next year if
you don’t make these toys go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Of course, there are toys enough without these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: You always find some extra children you didn’t
know about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: Certainly you do, <span class="smcap">Brownie</span>, send the
naughty toys in one at a time and we will hear what they
have to say. Now, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, be firm. You are so kind
hearted if a doll cries you’ll let her have her way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Now, <span class="smcap">Mother</span>, you’re as bad as I am.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> goes out and two tin soldiers enter, walking stiffly
and moving exactly together. They salute as they come
to a standstill.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: What’s this I hear? Why aren’t you packed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span>: I don’t want to be given to any child.
Suppose I should not be properly treated. A careless
boy might not treat me according to my rank. I am a
general—suppose a private soldier was placed in front
of me. Suppose he was given the best place in our box.
I never could stand that. What a fate for a General.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span>: <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span>, I am a private soldier
and I am proud of it. The Brownie who made me did a
fine job. Just see how well my uniform fits. I’m just
as proud as the General. I will not associate with
soldiers I have to salute all the time and wait on. If I
got put in the box with a General I wouldn’t like it any
more than he would. Children are very careless. Something
unpleasant might easily happen. I think it best
for me to stay right here. The Brownies can use me as
a pattern next Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: This is very strange. I never dreamed that you
toys didn’t get on perfectly well. After this I’ll put all
the officers in one box and all the common soldiers in
another.</p>

Shoes that Danced, and the poor little Match Girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Book</span>: I’m the Just-So Stories. Oh, how funny
I am. I tell about how the Elephant got his trunk, how
the Camel got his hump, and about man’s first friend,
the dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Book</span>: I am Alice in Wonderland. You’ll just love
Alice. Everybody does. The White Rabbit is the

and lots of pictures. The little girls’ grandmothers read

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Dear me. This is very annoying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: Be firm. Be firm.</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> brings in a <span class="smcap">Jumping Jack</span>.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jumping-Jack</span>: <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, I’m sorry to seem fussy but I
really can’t go out this year. How would you like to be
capering like this [<i>jerks about</i>] every time someone
pulled a string. Folks think a <span class="smcap">Jumping-Jack’s</span> arms
and legs never get tired but I want to tell you they do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span> [<i>together</i>]: Poor thing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> <i>brings in</i> <span class="smcap">Top</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Top</span> [<i>spinning round and round</i>]: <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, I’m so dizzy
my head will fly off. After I was made all the Brownies
in the workshop kept spinning me just because I have
such a sweet hum. If I have to be put on a Christmas
tree and be played with all day tomorrow I shall spin
myself to death. I expect to stay right here, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: But it isn’t hard work to spin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Top</span>: You just try it for a day, dear <span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> <i>brings in beautiful doll</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doll</span>: I suppose you’re cross, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, but I can’t help it.
I have heard the most terrible stories about the way dolls
are treated by careless little girls. They have their lovely
curls torn off and their eyes are poked in by little girl’s
fingers. They are left outdoors in the sun and rain and
that spoils the complexion. It took two days to make my
complexion and I will not have it spoiled. Think of
having this lovely dress made dirty by sticky fingers.
You and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span> will be lonesome. You really need
me any way. I have named myself since I do not intend
that any child shall have a chance to name me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doll</span>: It is beautiful. <span class="smcap">Gwendolyn Geraldine Genevieve
Arabella</span>. Isn’t that a delightful name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: I shall call you <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> for short. I can’t remember
all that list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doll</span>: <span class="smcap">Jack-of All-Trades</span>, you’ll address me by my
proper name or not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Don’t quarrel. He won’t call you anything for
you won’t be here. [<i><span class="smcap">Doll</span> cries.</i>]</p>


<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> brings in <span class="smcap">Fountain Pen</span>.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen</span>: <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, I’m entirely too smart to give away. I can
write wonderful things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: What have you written?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen</span>: I’ll say my last poem for you. I just wrote it on
my box lid. It is what a little boy said at a Christmas
entertainment and it’s about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: Say it for us, <span class="smcap">Pen</span>.</p>

Every year some child tries to see me fill his stocking

<p><span class="smcap">Pen</span>: You can see for yourself, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, that you need
some one like me with you all the time. If I can write
verses like that think how beautifully I could answer the
millions of letters you get every year from the children

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: Oh, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, I have just received a terrible message
on the wireless from a little settlement in Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: What is it? What is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: The message was sent by your helper, <span class="smcap">Fleet-Foot</span>.
He learned just an hour ago that there is a family
living in the little settlement that was not counted when
he made his census. There are two children—a boy and
a girl, both very small.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: Poor little things, and no presents left for
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: No, I must start in five minutes. There’s no time
to make anything for them now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: There’s nothing left in the workshop. I just
looked. It’s a shame. <span class="smcap">Fleet-Foot</span> says they are such
nice children.</p>

<p class="center"><i>During all this conversation the <span class="smcap">Tree</span> and the <span class="smcap">Toys</span> have
been listening very carefully. They come forward.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree</span>: How many children, did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span>: Two—very nice ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soldiers</span> [<i>together</i>]: Do you think they could tell a General
from a private?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: My dear <span class="smcap">Toys</span>, I leave it to your consciences. Do
you like to think of those two little children way up in
Alaska doing without any Christmas gifts because you
were selfish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toys</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tree</span> [<i>together</i>]: Oh, <span class="smcap">Santa</span>, you always get us
to do just what you want us to anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree</span>: Come on, folks, we might as well go in and be
packed. There’s nothing else to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toys</span>: Yes, come on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa</span>: I’m so glad Santa was firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa</span>: Before we go let’s sing one song together—a good
old Christmas song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Toys</span>: All right.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
